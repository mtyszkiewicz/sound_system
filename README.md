# Sound System
My personal home sound system setup, automated with Makefile.

Built using open-source software:
 * [Raspotify](https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify) - Systemd wrapper around popular Spotify Connect client â€” [Librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot).
 * [dsp](https://github.com/bmc0/dsp) - [Digital singal processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processor) used for [room correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_room_correction)
 * [Onkyo eISCP Control](https://github.com/miracle2k/onkyo-eiscp) - Controller for my Onkyo amplituner for turning the device on/off remotely.

All components are glued together using:
 * [ALSA](https://www.alsa-project.org/wiki/Main_Page) - Core linux audio functionality.
 * [LADSPA](https://www.ladspa.org/) - API for linux audio plugins.

## Dependencies
```
sudo apt install -y git libasound2-dev libssl-dev pkg-config python3-venv python3.9-dev ladspa-sdk
sudo apt-get -y install curl && curl -sL https://dtcooper.github.io/raspotify/install.sh | sh
```

## Terratec Aureon 7.1 USB
I use Terratec sound card to:
 * Capture audio from TV via S/PDIF optical cable
 * Capture audio from my DJ console via standard jack cable
 * Output audio to the Onkyo amplituner via another S/PDIF optical cable

Captured audio is sent to Raspberry PI for mixing with other sources like Raspotify.
After all the transformations it gets sent back to this device for playback.

### Configuration
You can adjust this sound card's controls using either `alsamixer` TUI, or `amixer` CLI.
The device itself has 4 sources:
 * Mic 1 - 2 channel input for Microphone #1
 * Mic 2 - 2 channel input for Microphone #2
 * Line - 4 channel Jack input
 * IEC958 - 4 channel S/PDIF (optical) input

`switch-jack-tv.sh` script makes it easy to toggle between Jack and TV input.
